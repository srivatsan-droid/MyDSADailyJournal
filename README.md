## 📌 About This Repo
This repository is my journey of **practicing DSA for Tech Interviews** – documenting what I’m learning, how I’m approaching problems, and the **patterns** I’m following.  
I’ll be solving the **NeetCode 250 sheet** 🚀, explaining solutions, and tracking progress here.

## 🛠 Step 1 – Learn a Language (Java)
Don’t overcomplicate things. Just pick one language and stick to it.  
For me, that’s **Java**. I went through [W3Schools Java](https://www.w3schools.com/java/) for the basics. ✅  

---

## 📚 Step 2 – Learn DSA Concepts
Once comfortable with syntax, learn **core DSA concepts**.  
Great resource 👉 [GFG DSA Tutorial](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa/dsa-tutorial-learn-data-structures-and-algorithms/).  

---

## 🧩 Step 3 – Choose a Problem Sheet
Random practice ≠ smart practice.  
Patterns matter more than raw number of problems.  

I picked:  
👉 **[NeetCode 250](https://neetcode.io/practice)**  
This covers almost all the patterns that are asked in interviews.

## ⚡ My Practice Rules
- 🕐 **45 Min Rule** – Give max 45 minutes per problem.  
  - If stuck → look at solution → understand → retry.  
  - If you can’t solve in 45 mins, you likely won’t in a real interview.  
- 📅 **Weekend Pattern Review** – Revisit patterns, consolidate learning.  
- 💡 **Focus on Logic Building** – Struggling is where real learning happens.  
- 🔁 **Consistency > Intensity** – 4 problems/day → ~240 in 2 months.
